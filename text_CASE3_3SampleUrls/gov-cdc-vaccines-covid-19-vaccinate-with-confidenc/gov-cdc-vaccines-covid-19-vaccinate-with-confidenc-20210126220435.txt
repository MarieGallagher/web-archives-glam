Building Confidence in COVID-19 Vaccines
Remind people that the goal is for everyone to be able to get a COVID-19 vaccination easily as soon as large quantities of vaccine are available. Then provide people with actions they can take before they get vaccinated when supply may be limited. Such as:
- Learn about the COVID-19 vaccines plans in your local area and make a vaccination plan for yourself or family members for when vaccine is offered.
- Learn more about the new COVID-19 vaccines and their benefits.
- Become a vaccine ambassador by sharing accurate and timely information about COVID-19 vaccines and information on local vaccination efforts with the people who need it most.
- Continue to take recommend actions to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.
What Is Vaccine Confidence?
Vaccine confidence is the trust that patients, their families, and providers have in:
- Recommended vaccines
- Providers who administer vaccines
- Processes and policies that lead to vaccine development, licensure or authorization, manufacturing, and recommendations for use
Many factors influence vaccine decision-making, including cultural, social, and political factors; individual and group factors; and vaccine-specific factors. However, confidence in the vaccines, the vaccinator, and the system all support the decision to get vaccinated.
Why Is It Important?
Some people may hesitate to get a COVID-19 vaccine. They may want answers to their questions about the process for developing and authorizing these vaccines and information about their safety and effectiveness. People may have previous experiences that affect their trust and confidence in the health system.
By taking time to listen to their concerns and answer their questions, we can help people become confident in their decision to be vaccinated. Also, when you decide to get vaccinated and share the reasons why you did, you can have a powerful influence on your family and community. Strong confidence in the vaccines within communities leads to more people getting vaccinated, which leads to fewer COVID-19 illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.
