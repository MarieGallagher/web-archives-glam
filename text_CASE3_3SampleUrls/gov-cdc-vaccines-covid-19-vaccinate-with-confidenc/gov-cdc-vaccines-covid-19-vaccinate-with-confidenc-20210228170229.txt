What Is Vaccine Confidence?
Vaccine confidence is the trust that patients, their families, and providers have in:
- Recommended vaccines
- Providers who administer vaccines
- Processes and policies that lead to vaccine development, licensure or authorization, manufacturing, and recommendations for use
- Learn about the COVID-19 vaccines plans in your local area and make a vaccination plan for yourself or family members for when vaccine is offered.
- Learn more about the new COVID-19 vaccines and their benefits.
- Become a vaccine ambassador by sharing accurate and timely information about COVID-19 vaccines and information on local vaccination efforts with the people who need it most.
- Continue to take recommend actions to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.
