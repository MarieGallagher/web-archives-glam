How you can help researchers find ways to prevent and treat COVID-19.
YOU CAN HELP
Scientists and doctors still need your help to develop safe and effective vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19. Scientists continue to develop new vaccines and test treatments for COVID-19.
If you have COVID-19 now, you can join a clinical trial to help find better treatments.
If you have had COVID-19 in the past, you can donate plasma or blood to help others recover.
Physicians can help their patients register for clinical trials.
WE NEED PEOPLE LIKE YOU
