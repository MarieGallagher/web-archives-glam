INTRODUCTION
Ensuring Inclusion in Clinical Trials
We want to ensure that all people regardless of their race or ethnicity or disability are included in COVID-19 clinical trials. There can be no barriers for at-risk communities to enroll in clinical trials due to costs or access or lack of information. Because clinical trials evaluate whether a medical product is safe and effective for all populations, enrollment should include individuals of all races and ethnicities as well as those who have disabilities. Only with representation from all groups of people in clinical trials for regulated medical products will we be able to help researchers find better preventions and treatments that work for all communities and help us win the fight against COVID-19.
